              In 2017, I watched a YouTube video about programming, specifically
              learning web development in spring boot. I found many of the
              concepts challenging to understand, but this sparked my interest
              in programming. I started researching how websites are made and
              discovered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
              At that time, I didn&apos;t have my own laptop, so I installed a
              basic code editor on my mobile phone and began writing HTML code.
              I created simple website designs. I was excited by the process,
              and it felt like a major accomplishment. However, at the end of
              2017, I had my board exams, and I had to pause my learning.

              {" "}
              Afterward, I didn&apos;t have the opportunity to pursue
              programming, and I became distracted for several years. I
              struggled to find my true passion and wasn't happy with my college
              degree. As a result, I decided to drop out and began focusing on
              web development. This decision brought me a sense of satisfaction
              and fulfillment that I had been searching for.

              Since I didnâ€™t have math in my 12th standard, I was unable to
              pursue a BCA or BTech. Instead, I enrolled in an open university
              and am currently studying Economics with Honors. Now that I have
              mathematics in my curriculum, I plan to pursue an MCA after
              completing my bachelor's degree. My goal is to become a core
              software developer.
